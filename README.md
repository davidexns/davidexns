### Hi, I'm David!

I am a full-stack developer passionate about building tools and applications that make things easier for myself and others. I primarily enjoy building for the front-end in JavaScript/TypeScript, React (also dabbling with and enjoying Svelte), and Next, but I also enjoy creating tools/components that foster a better developer experience or improving the value of a test suite.
